# The Final War

This text-based adventure game is a Sci-Fi action game set in the year 2075 on the planet Nefarax. You are deployed to fight in the war for the first time, and your mission is to take out the warlord so he does not take over the planet. Do you have the power to take him out or will he defeat you and take over your home?

**Future Development**

This game is not 100% complete, but it is close. There is a small issue and bug that needs to be fixed.

- Fix the issue where the whole game only runs if you are on chapter 6
- Fix the bug where some players will get negative ammo depending on their choices.
